##### IMPORT SECTION #####
import tensorflow as tf
import keras, os #Provides infrastructure for Neural Network (NN)
from keras.models import Sequential #specifies that our NN is sequential (one layer links to the next, etc.)
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D , Flatten, Dense
#Conv2D: images are 2D, hence 2D. Tells system to use Convolutional NNs (CNN)
#MaxPool2D: Max Pooling has been found to be the better option for pooling with image identification (try avg at least once jic)
#Flatten: Converts 2D arrays into a single, continuous vector (DO NOT CHANGE!!!)
#Dense: last 3 layers; condenses outputs from previous layers into a smaller output

from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
#Helps scale images and orient them correctly

##### SETUP #####

imageResX = 224 #set to camera specifications. best are 64, 256
imageResY = 224 #set to camera specifications. best are 64, 256
channelCount = 3 #color channels. Consider changing based on image colors, although VGG-16 might only take in RGB

#Sets the directories as global variables for the sake of convienence
mainDIR = ""
trainDIR = mainDIR + '/Training/'
testDIR = mainDIR + '/Testing/'

"""#The following sets up the classes we are sorting mammals into
      #This is automatically inferred from the program. MAKE SURE ALL SUBDIRECTORIES OF trainDIR are properly labeled!!
   classNames = ['jackal-front', 'jackal-side', 'jackal-back', 'fox-front', 'fox-side', 'fox-back', 'other', 'nothing']"""

trainData = ImageDataGenerator().flow_from_directory(directory = trainDIR, target_size=(imageResX,imageResY), color_mode = 'grayscale', shuffle = True)

##### IMPLEMENTING VGG-16 MODEL #####

#input_shape: image dimensions + color channels
 #include_top: MUST BE FALSE! true would force the size of the architecture. Images that do not comply with size specifications will alter weights!!!
#weights: imagenet because it is industry standard
#classes: 8 classes; [jackal, fox] front, side, back, other, nothing. Uncertainty is decided by confidence level
VGG = keras.applications.VGG16(input_shape = (imageResX, imageResY, 3), include_top = False, weights = 'imagenet', classes = 8)

VGG.trainable = False #Not sure if needed. Test with and without. Pretty sure this should be removed

model = keras.Sequential([VGG,
                         keras.layers.Flatten(),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu'),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu'),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = 2,   activation = 'softmax')])
#we have 3 dense layers (standard CNN framework), the first 2 have 256 units (nodes/neurons), the last has 2
#relu is industry standard; known for being optimal; test with Leaky ReLu for extra performance
#softmax function converts vector of numbers into probability distribution; used to guess what mammal is in image; good for multiclassed datasets (what we are using) + industry standard

#compile the model
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy, metrics = ['accuracy'])
#optimizer: AdaM performs best in industry. (Experiment with AdaMax. Rising in standard)
