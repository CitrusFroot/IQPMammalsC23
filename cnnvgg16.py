##### IMPORT SECTION #####
import tensorflow as tf
import keras, os #Provides infrastructure for Neural Network (NN)
from keras.models import Sequential #specifies that our NN is sequential (one layer links to the next, etc.)
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D , Flatten, Dense
#Conv2D: images are 2D, hence 2D. Tells system to use Convolutional NNs (CNN)
#MaxPool2D: Max Pooling has been found to be the better option for pooling with image identification (try avg at least once jic)
#Flatten: Converts 2D arrays into a single, continuous vector (DO NOT CHANGE!!!)
#Dense: last 3 layers; condenses outputs from previous layers into a smaller output

from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
#Helps scale images and orient them correctly

##### SETUP #####

imageResX = 224 #set to camera specifications. best are 64, 256
imageResY = 224 #set to camera specifications. best are 64, 256
channelCount = 1 #1 = grayscale, 3 = RGB, 4 = RGBA. Use 1 for this project

#Sets the directories as global variables for the sake of convienence
trainDIR = 'E:\All types of images/Training Data/'

#The following sets up the classes we are sorting mammals into
#This is automatically inferred from the program. MAKE SURE ALL SUBDIRECTORIES OF trainDIR are properly labeled!!
#This specifies the order we want them to be organized in. so jackal-front = 0, jackal-side = 1, ... nothing = 7
classNames = ['fox-front', 'fox-side', 'fox-back']#,'jackal-front', 'jackal-side', 'jackal-back', 'other', 'nothing']

##### PREPROCESSING #####

#pulls images from dataset, labels them, divides them into testing and training data, and shuffles them in memory
trainData = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(directory = trainDIR, labels = 'inferred', class_names = classNames, color_mode = 'rgb', image_size = (imageResX, imageResY), shuffle = True, validation_split = 0.3, seed = 19121954, subset = 'training')

#The following nested for loop is necessary because 
#for every batch (32 images) in trainData, and for every image in each batch, do:
#grayscale all the images
#interpret grayscale images as RGB images
for batch in trainData:
    i = 0
    for img in batch:
        if(i % 2 == 0):
            img = tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale(img)
            img = tf.image.grayscale_to_rgb(img)
        i = i + 1
    
#VGG-16 + ImageNet only works with RGB. the following line of code converts the grayscale color channel into RGB. The image is still gray
##### IMPLEMENTING VGG-16 MODEL #####

#input_shape: image dimensions + color channels
 #include_top: MUST BE FALSE! true would force the size of the architecture. Images that do not comply with size specifications will alter weights!!!
#weights: imagenet for transfer learning
#classes: 8 classes; [jackal, fox] front, side, back, other, nothing. Uncertainty is decided by confidence level
VGG = keras.applications.VGG16(input_shape = (imageResX, imageResY, 3), include_top = False, weights = 'imagenet', classes = 3) #classes should = 8

VGG.trainable = False 

model = keras.Sequential([VGG,
                         keras.layers.Flatten(),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu'),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu'),
                         keras.layers.Dense(units = len(classNames),   activation = 'softmax')])
#we have 3 dense layers (standard CNN framework), the first 2 have 256 units (nodes/neurons), the last has 2
#relu is industry standard; known for being optimal; test with Leaky ReLu for extra performance
#softmax function converts vector of numbers into probability distribution; used to guess what mammal is in image; good for multiclassed datasets (what we are using) + industry standard

#compile the model
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])
#optimizer: AdaM performs best in industry. (Experiment with AdaMax. Rising in standard)
