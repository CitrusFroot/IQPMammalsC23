Issues you may run into and how to fix them (For programmers)

1. Image-System incompatibility
    our model works with grayscale images that are interpreted as RGB. The most common issue that this relates to
    is when the photos you are analyzing are not in the correct format. To fix this, simply run the following lines on each image:
    
    img = tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale(img)
    img = tf.image.grayscale_to_rgb(img)

    Note that you can skip the first line if you know for certain your image is already grayscale.
    However, it must be interpreted as RGB at the end.
