Issues you may run into and how to fix them:
1. MegaDetector failed to run

This is most likely caused by the GPU on your system. This can be solved in two ways:
    1. Purchase a CUDA enabled GPU
    2. Switch the processor used by MegaDetector to the CPU. Note that doing this will greatly extend the runtime of the program, and should be done at night or at closing hours.

2. The AI keeps making too many inaccuracies

To address this, the simplest method is to keep reviewing the predictions it makes and retraining the model. While this will take time, as more and more data gets processed, it will perform better.
If this is not an option, the next best thing is to contact the developers at the following emails:
    jtreiss@wpi.edu
    lhall@wpi.edu
    lcarleu@wpi.edu
    jdrockmael@wpi.edu

If neither of these options are viable, utilizing just MegaDetector is also a solution. Any issues that arise can be addressed by contacting Microsoft.

3. I want the AI to label more animals than just jackals and foxes

This problem requires the source code of the AI to be altered. The best course of action is to contact the developers at:
    jtreiss@wpi.edu
    lhall@wpi.edu
    lcarleu@wpi.edu
    jdrockmael@wpi.edu
or contact WPI for a new research team to expand this project.
