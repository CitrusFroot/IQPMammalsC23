#Conv2D: images are 2D, hence 2D. Tells system to use Convolutional NNs (CNN)
#MaxPool2D: Max Pooling has been found to be the better option for pooling with image identification (try avg at least once jic)
#Flatten: Converts 2D arrays into a single, continuous vector (DO NOT CHANGE!!!)
#Dense: last 3 layers; condenses outputs from previous layers into a smaller output
#RandomCrop allows us to hone our data to focus on specific aspects of an image
